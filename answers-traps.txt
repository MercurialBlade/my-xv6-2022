1. Function arguments are stored in registers a0 to a7. In main's call to printf, the value 13 is in a2.

2. The call to function f and g are inlined by the compiler and do not appear as jal/jalr instructions in main.

3. The printf function is located at address 0x642.

4. Just after the jalr to printf in main, the ra register contains: 0x34+4 = 0x38
   Noting: The jumping distance 1554 can be calculated: 0x642-0x30=0x612

5. HE110 World
   Big-endian equivalent: i = 0x726c6400
   No need to change 57616.

6. A random value in register a2 will be printed.
